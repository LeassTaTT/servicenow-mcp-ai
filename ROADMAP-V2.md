# servicenow-mcp-ai — v2.0 Execution Roadmap

Date: 2026-06-21 · The operational plan for the next major version. Derived from
[BUSINESS-ANALYSIS-V2.md](BUSINESS-ANALYSIS-V2.md) (the "why" and the sequencing) and
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) (the full DF-/DX- task specs). This file is the **execution
tracker**: what ships in v2.0, in what order, and the definition of done for each.

## Milestone definition

> **v1.x = breadth** (can touch all of ServiceNow). **v2.0 = trust + depth + reach**
> (safe to let it write, understands the instance, reachable by teams/agents).

The API surface is complete; v2.0 is the release that makes the breadth **safe** and
**discoverable**. Business framing and market rationale: BUSINESS-ANALYSIS-V2 §2, §11.

## Sequencing (must-haves first)

The business analysis cut line for a tight single-maintainer 2.0 is **DF-0, DF-2, DF-1,
DX-1, DX-3**; DF-4/DF-5/DF-6 follow in 2.1 if capacity demands triage.

| #   | Item     | Pillar      | Why this order                                                       | Status         |
| --- | -------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1   | **DF-0** | Depth       | Precondition for DF-1/DF-4; closes the permission paradox (R1/R2/B4) | 🟢 preflight shipped |
| 2   | **DF-2** | Trust       | The root enabler — makes raw-REST writes safe (dry-run + audit)      | 🚧 next        |
| 3   | **DF-1** | Depth       | Headline "knows your instance"; extends Phase 8 codecheck            | ⬜             |
| 4   | **DX-1** | Discovery   | MCP Registry + Claude Code plugin — biggest adoption lever           | ⬜             |
| 5   | **DX-3** | Discovery   | One sharp "find-usages / what-runs / dev-vs-prod" demo               | ⬜             |
| —   | DF-4/5/6 | Depth/Reach | where-used graph · redaction · HTTP transport — 2.1 triage           | ⬜ deferred    |

## Definition of done (per item)

Each item ships green (`npm run check`), with tests in the same change, docs/manifest
regenerated, and the README/env reference kept in sync (the project's standing guardrail).

### DF-0 — Capability preflight + recommended read-role profile (preflight shipped)

- [x] `api/capabilities.ts` — probe which admin-restricted `sys_*` artefact tables the
      connected user can actually read; map to achievable higher-level capabilities
      (schema reads, script intelligence, ACL audit).
- [x] `servicenow_check_capabilities` admin tool (always-on, read-only).
- [x] `servicenow://capabilities` MCP resource.
- [x] Tests (probe readable / 403 / transport) + regenerated manifest + README;
      `npm run check` green (240 tests, coverage 95/82/99).
- [ ] _Remaining:_ make the script-intelligence / codecheck tools consume the preflight
      and report "N artefacts unreadable (needs role X)" rather than a silently empty
      result. (Next sub-task of DF-0.)

### DF-2 — Plan-and-apply + local audit journal (next)

- [ ] A "plan" mode for every write tool: resolve the target and return a structured
      before/after diff **without** mutating, gated by `apply: true`
      (`SN_WRITE_MODE=plan|apply`, default plan).
- [ ] Append every executed mutation to a local append-only journal
      (`docs/instance/<profile>/write-journal.{md,jsonl}`).

### DF-1 — Instance linter + security scan

- [ ] Fold a security dimension into `code_health`: world-/role-open ACLs, tables with no
      ACL, public Scripted REST/pages, admin-overlap roles, `eval`/`gs.getUser()` in ACL
      scripts. Gate the readable scope behind DF-0.

### DX-1 / DX-3 — Discovery

- [ ] MCP Registry listing (`server.json` is ready) + a Claude Code plugin/skills bundle.
- [ ] A README/site hero demo + GIF: find-usages, what-runs-on-save, dev-vs-prod diff.

## Guardrails (unchanged)

Always-green gate, one commit per task, new tools added **only** through the declarative
manifest, every behavioural change ships with a test in the same commit.
