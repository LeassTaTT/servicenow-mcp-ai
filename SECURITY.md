# Security

## Reporting

Report vulnerabilities privately to <ivanbbaev@gmail.com> or via
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/LeassTaTT/servicenow-mcp/issues).

## Security model (summary)

- **Transport:** stdio only; logs go to stderr as structured JSON. The
  password/token is never logged and never returned by any tool.
- **Credentials:** a git-ignored env file (`SN_ENV_FILE`, then
  `~/.config/servicenow-mcp-ai/.env`, then the project `.env`); real environment
  variables take precedence. Runtime updates go through
  `servicenow_set_credentials`.
- **Two-axis policy:** `SN_TABLES_ALLOW`/`SN_TABLES_DENY` + `SN_READONLY`
  govern the Table API; `SN_PACKAGES_DENY`/`SN_PACKAGES_READONLY` govern the
  plugin-backed APIs. **A table deny does not restrict the plugin APIs** — use
  the package axis for those (see the README security notes).
- **Network:** HTTPS to the instance, an SSRF guard for internal/loopback
  hosts, and a host-suffix restriction — without `SN_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, only
  `*.service-now.com` instances are contacted, so a redirected or mistyped host
  cannot silently receive credentials. Per-request timeout, retry with backoff,
  and a result-size guard round it out.
- **Env file:** written owner-only (`0600`); it holds a plaintext password and
  is never group/world-readable.

## Hardened defaults

Earlier single-user builds accepted two risks; for the public release the
conservative defaults win, and both are now enforced in code (with tests):

- **Env-file mode `0600`** instead of the default `0644` (`config.ts`).
- **Host must be `*.service-now.com`** unless `SN_ALLOWED_HOSTS` is set
  (`host.ts`). Set `SN_ALLOWED_HOSTS` to opt in a custom or sovereign-cloud
  domain; the SSRF guard and X-2 elicitation confirmation still apply on top.
